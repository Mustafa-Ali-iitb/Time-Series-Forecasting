# Time-Series-Forecasting

In this repository we will be discussing various time series forecasting approach to predict stock market price using classical as well as deep learning approach including CNN, LSTM, and MLP networks. Each methods have been explained in there respective code file with results attached

## Data
We have used closing price data of 9 different firm in DATA folder

## Reference 
I have refered to [Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting be Jason Brownlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com/deep-learning-for-time-series-forecasting/) for implementing methods disscussed mentioned
